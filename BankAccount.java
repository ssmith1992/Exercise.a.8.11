//to deduct every time the user withdraws money. The default value is $0.00, but the client can change the value.
//Deduct the transaction fee money during every withdraw call (but not from deposits). Make sure that the balance
//cannot go negative during a withdrawal. If the withdrawal (amount plus transaction fee) would cause it to become
//negative, donâ€™t modify the balance at all.
